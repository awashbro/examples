# Examples from Scientific research computing

This folder contains some highlights of research computing activities that I have recently undertaken as part my role as a senior research associate in High Energy Physics:

- **Weather prediction**: Using machine learning classification techniques to predict the type of weather given ground observations
- **Software Quality**: Using data visualisation, continuous integration and code review practices to reduce software defect volume in a large collaborative software framework
- **HPC optimisation**: Determining the root cause for inefficient workload processing on Supercomputing facilities by the analysis of application logs and file access patterns

A README file resides at the top of each example directory to give a some background information of the activity and links to any further reading if you are interested. I will add plenty more examples with time!

**Please note**: The code itself is not intended to work as a standalone solution and is only for the purposes of illustration.
